# Video-game solver

Automated solution finder and executioner for whatever video-game.
This is just a template for me to make solvers faster and easier.

## Requirements

I only ran this on linux so that's what I'm gonna list:

`apt-get install libxcb1 libxrandr2 libdbus-1-3 libxdo-dev`

- `libxcb1`, `libxrandr2`, `libdbus-1-3` are for the `screenshots` crate

- `libxdo-dev` is for the `enigo`
